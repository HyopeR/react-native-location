# React Native Location

A **high-performance** React Native location library. Seamlessly tracks users’ location **in both foreground and background**, making it easy to build **location-aware mobile experiences** with minimal setup.

## ⚙️ Requirements
This package works **only** with **React Native 0.75+** and **requires New Architecture (Fabric)** to be enabled. Ensure your project meets the following peer dependencies:

```json
{
  "react": "*",
  "react-native": ">=0.75.0"
}
```

## ❇️ Fork
This library is a fork of the original [react-native-location](https://github.com/timfpark/react-native-location) repository.
All original authors’ rights are preserved, and this fork continues maintenance while adding New Architecture support.
